                            It is often tempting to pepper newspaper writing with acronyms or abbreviations familiar to the writer. Use caution. They are often unfamiliar to the reader. Yale, with its compendium of abbreviations and acronyms for everything from parking lots to libraries, provides many such temptations. This booklet and the AP Stylebook include individual entries for many particular abbreviations and acronyms. General principles:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>BEFORE A NAME Always abbreviate the following titles when used before a full name outside direct quotations: <i>Dr.</i>, <i>Gov.</i>, <i>Lt. Gov.</i>,  <i>Rep.</i>, <i>the Rev.</i>, and <i>Sen.</i> See the AP Stylebook for military titles. Spell out all except <i>Dr.</i>, <i>Mr.</i>  and <i>Mrs.</i> when used before a name in direct quotation. See <a href=#courtesy_titles>courtesy titles</a> and <a href=#legislative_titles>legislative titles</a> in this site for more information. See the AP Stylebook for guidelines on religious titles. See <a href=#titles>titles</a> in this booklet for general titles, organizational titles, job titles and professional titles. See also <a href=#professor>professor</a>. Only medical doctors receive the title of Dr., not Ph.D. holders.</li>
                            <li>AFTER A NAME Abbreviate <i>junior</i> and <i>senior</i> after an individual’s name. Do not use an intervening comma: <i>Michael Jones III</i>, <i>John DeStefano Jr.</i> Abbreviate <i>company</i>, <i>corporation</i>, <i>incorporated</i> and <i>limited</i> when used after the name of a corporate entity:  <i>AOL Time Warner Inc.</i>, <i>Philip Morris Cos. Inc.</i> See also individual entries in the AP Stylebook for major corporations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Do not create acronyms that do not exist. For acronyms of organization names that are used by some people, especially organization members, but may not be familiar to many readers, spell out the organization name on all references or introduce the acronym if the name is excessively bulky: <i>The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or MEChA, is Yale’s largest student organization for students of Mexican descent.</i> <u>Do not use parentheses to introduce acronyms.</u> See individual entries for guidance on many organizations. See also the <a href="#index_yale_buildings">Index of Yale Buildings</a> at the end of this booklet. For acronyms that end in “s,” like Yale-NUS, use only an apostrophe to create a possessive. Do not add an additional “s.”

                        <p>
                            In most cases, it is acceptable to refer to abortion-rights and anti-abortion activist groups with the labels they prefer. <i>Pro-life</i> and <i>pro-choice</i> are acceptable in reference to the standard two sides of the debate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If, however, it is particularly important to maintain a more pronounced appearance of impartiality, use <i>abortion-rights group</i> or <i>anti-abortion group</i> or something similar.

                            For degrees that consist of two capital letters, write out the name of the degree. Do not use <i>B.A.</i>, <i>B.S.</i>, <i>M.A.</i>, <i>M.S.</i>, <i>Ph.D.</i>,  etc. except in a direct quotation <b>(MD-PhD is acceptable)</b>: <i>Joe Kagan, who received a doctorate in history from Yale, teaches at Ohio State University. Susan Kagan, who graduated from Yale with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, went to graduate school in England. Yale gave an honorary master’s degree to each new member of the Yale Corporation who did not have a postgraduate degree.</i>

                            For degrees that consist of three capital letters, abbreviations without periods are acceptable if writing out the name of the degree is awkward: <i>King, who has an MBA from Cornell University, will serve as the next vice president for finance and administration.</i> Other common three-capital degrees include <i>master’s of public health (MPH)</i> and <i>master’s of fine arts (MFA)</i>.

                            Note the spelling. There are more than a dozen a cappella singing groups at Yale, although new ones spring up and flicker out every year. <i>A cappella</i> refers to vocalists or vocal groups that sing without instrumental accompaniment. There are also other musical singing groups at Yale, such as opera companies and folk groups, that do not perform a cappella. Do not refer to these as a cappella groups. The prominent a cappella groups, and the years they were established are:

                        <p>
                            Always spell out <i>alley</i>, <i>drive</i>, <i>road</i> etc., and capitalize when part of a formal street name. Lowercase when used alone or with more than one street name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Always use figures for an address, unless the address starts a sentence: <i>The Provost’s Office moved to 1 Hillhouse Ave.</i> But: <i>One Hillhouse Ave. was the home of Undergraduate Career Services for 10 years.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For addresses in New Haven, list only the street address. For addresses outside of New Haven, list the city and, if outside Connecticut, the state as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When identifying individuals, it is not necessary to list their exact home address. Usually, writing their street name, for New Haven residents, or their town, for non-New Haven residents, is sufficient. <i>Roger Thompson of Munson Street and Sue Smith of Hamden.</i>

                            When identifying sources who are not named, be sure to report accurately the terms of the agreement of anonymity. Use <i>spoke on condition of anonymity</i> only if the person agreed to speak on condition that his or her name not be used. If the source asks that the reporter not use the source’s last name, write <i>Jimmy, who asked that his last name not be used,</i> or something similar.

                            On the one hand, the use of anonymous sources weakens a story since it casts doubt on the validity of the story in the mind of the reader. On the other hand, it may not be possible to gather and report information without promising a source protection. Some guidelines:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Balance the doubt caused against the information gained. Do not grant anonymity to a source who provides information that is easily obtainable elsewhere, of a generic nature or of tangential relevance.</li>
                            <li>Grant anonymity only if you and the source specifically discuss it. Do not turn an on-the-record conversation into a not-for-attribution conversation after the fact.</li>
                            <li>Print the information provided by an anonymous source only if you are fully confident in the source’s reliability.</li>

                            Use brackets, not parentheses, to replace omitted material in quoted matter. Avoid excessively long phrases in brackets. Use brackets only as absolutely necessary to clarify the meaning of a quotation. It is vital that quotations be reported accurately as stated; overuse of brackets often indicates that a quotation should be paraphrased.

                            See the <a href="#index_yale_buildings">Index of Yale Buildings</a> at the end of this booklet. It is permissible to use the following abbreviations on second reference for Linsly-Chittenden Hall, Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall and William L. Harkness Hall: <i>LC</i>, <i>SSS</i> and <i>WLH</i>. These abbreviations are also permissible on first reference in room numbers, in direct quotations and in headlines, although it is ideal to spell out the full name of the building somewhere in the story. Do not abbreviate any other Yale buildings in any situation, including quotations. Rather, use brackets as necessary. Example:  <i>“I really liked being in [Sloane Physics Laboratory] all day,” professor Charles Ahn said.</i> See also <a href="#room_numbers">room numbers</a>.

                            Most stories not written by the Associated Press carry a byline or a tagline. A byline is styled as follows: <i>By John Smith</i>. A tagline is styled as follows: <i>—John Smith</i>. It is right-justified beneath the story text, with a long (or em-) dash. Guidelines for bylines and taglines:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Briefs written by one or more reporters carry those names in the tagline in alphabetical order by last name, regardless of status: <i>—John Jones and Mary Smith</i>.</li>
                            <li>Briefs provided by the Associated Press carry the tagline <i>—Associated Press</i>. If the AP is the second author in a tagline, use <i>The Associated Press</i>: <i>—John Jones and The Associated Press</i>.</li>
                            <li>Briefs written by an editor carry the tagline <i>—Yale Daily News</i>.</li>
                            <li>Stories written by a single reporter carry that reporter’s byline.</li>
                            <li>Stories written or reported by more than one reporter in which all contributors participated roughly equally carry all names as bylines, styled as follows: <i>By John Jones and Mary Smith</i> or <i>By John Jones, Mary Smith and Jimmy McBruce</i>. Names are listed alphabetically in multiple-bylined stories, except that staff reporters are listed before contributing reporters.</li>
                            <li>Stories written or reported by more than one reporter in which one or more reporters contributed substantially less than the others carry the primary reporter’s name (or names) in the byline and the secondary reporters in the tagline. In this case, tagline style is as follows: <i>—Staff Reporter John Public contributed to this story.</i> Or, for contributing reporters: <i>—Additional reporting by John Smith.</i> If both a staff and contributing reporter need to be mentioned, use the appropriate sentences for each, conjoined by a semicolon: <i>—Staff Reporter John Public contributed to this story; additional reporting by John Smith.</i></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Note that a period should be included in the tagline only when it forms a complete sentence.

                            Avoid unnecessary capitalization. Read the AP Stylebook’s entry on capitalization. Consult individual entries in this book and the AP Stylebook and Webster’s New World College dictionary to resolve other questions. Do not capitalize standalone common nouns. For example, <i>the center</i> for the Schwarzman Center, or <i>the senate</i> for the YCC senate.

                            Yale insists on using <i>chair</i> as the formal title of the heads of academic programs and departments and committees. Use <i>chair</i> when referring directly to the Yale position, but <u>in this instance</u> do not capitalize before a name: <i>Yale President Richard Levin said yesterday he would name Hazel Carby chair of the new Department of African American Studies. Levin said Math Department chair Peter Jones would lead the committee.</i> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Chairman</i> or <i>chairwoman</i> indicates the title of the position, but (like professor/coach) is not capitalized before a name, unless it is the official title: <i>Yale Daily News Chairman Joseph Lieberman ’64</i>. <i>Chair</i> indicates the same position, but only in very specific contexts as mentioned above, or in organizations whose head is specified as such, e.g. <i>GESO Chair Aaron Greenberg GRD ’18</i>. When in doubt, use <i>chairman</i>. Never use <i>chairperson</i> or <i>chairpeople</i> unless preferred by the individual or organization; use <i>chairman</i> or <i>chairmen</i> when gender is unspecified or unknown, or for a group of mixed gender.

                            The Civilian Review Board is designed to monitor citizen complaints against New Haven police officers.

Members serve three-year staggered terms.

It does not hold any power of subpoena. It reviews all civilian complaints against officers. It can ask the Internal Values and Ethics Unit to investigate any complaint and may review any investigation by the unit. The board can make recommendations regarding discipline to the chief and the Board of Police Commissioners, but the commissioners and the chief are the only entities legally empowered to discipline officers.

                            There are two types of courts, federal and state, in New Haven. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FEDERAL: The federal court system has three primary levels: the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals and the District Courts. Bankruptcy Court is also federal.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The U.S. Court of Appeals is divided into 13 circuits. Connecticut, along with New York and Vermont, falls within the 2nd Circuit. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is located in New York City.</li>
                            <li>The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut has a courthouse at 141 Church St., across from the Green. There are also federal District Courts located in Bridgeport, Hartford and Waterbury.</li>
                            <li>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut has an office in the Connecticut Financial Center at 157 Church St. There are also Bankruptcy Courts in Bridgeport and Hartford.</li>
                            <li>The formal names of courts — <i>2nd Circuit Court of Appeals</i>, <i>U.S. District Courts</i> — are capitalized, even when plural. See the AP Stylebook for more information on the federal court system, including style rules.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            STATE: The Connecticut state court system also has three main levels: the Connecticut Supreme Court, the Appellate Court and the Superior Courts.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Connecticut Supreme Court is located in Hartford, as is the Appellate Court.</li>
                            <li>Superior Court is a term that applies to three sublevels: the Judicial District Courts, the Geographical Area Courts and the Juvenile Matters Courts. New Haven has one of each. The division between the Judicial Districts Courts and the Geographical Area Courts is not always clear, but in general more serious matters are handled in the Judicial District Courts.</li>
                            <li>The New Haven Judicial District Court is located at 235 Church St.</li>
                            <li>The court for Geographical Area 23 at New Haven is located at 121 Elm St., next to the <a href="#new_haven_free_public_library">New Haven Free Public Library</a>.</li>
                            <li>The Juvenile Matters Court in New Haven is located at 239 Whalley Ave.</li>                               
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Note that all three courts may properly be referred to as Superior Court, and should be in most contexts. It is preferable to avoid explaining more complicated terms unless they directly relate to the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Information on other types of state courts, such as Probate Court, Community Court or the drug courts, may be found on the Connecticut state website or in judicial directories.

                            In general, capitalize only when the full, official name of a department or program is used, when metonymy is used (below), or when the full name is inverted around the word of: <i>Several professors in the Department of Chemistry said yesterday that they would leave Yale. Three professors in the Chemistry Department made a groundbreaking discovery.</i> This differs from the AP Stylebook.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The metonymic use (<i>Chemistry</i>, <i>Physics</i>) is acceptable for stories in which it would be cumbersome to repeat full department names. <i>The Chemistry chairman is a dapper individual.</i> This use is acceptable in headlines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lowercase when referring to the academic discipline: <i>He said chemistry at Yale is a lot of fun.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, always capitalize any words in a department or program name that are proper nouns or adjectives: <i>Jones said African American studies is a growing field.</i> (academic discipline) Also: <i>Jones said African American Studies is growing.</i> (Yale department)

                            Often used when the writer means because of: <i>Because of</i> (not <i>due to</i>) <i>financial aid changes, more international students will come to Yale next year. He was sidelined because of</i> (not <i>due to</i>) <i>a broken rib</i>.

                        <p>
                            <i>Due to</i> means <i>caused by</i> (not <i>because of</i>): <i>An omission due to poor training caused the crash, officials said.</i> Note that <i>because of</i> could not be substituted in this sentence.

                            A good rule of thumb is this: If the result is a noun (such as <i>the library’s closure</i>), use <i>due to</i>. If the result is a clause or a complete sentence (such as <i>the library was closed</i>), use <i>because of</i>.

After Yale gifted the young college, previously known as the Collegiate School, with books and other goods, it was renamed Yale College in 1718. Yale was born April 5, 1649, in Boston. He died in 1721 in England and is buried in Wrexham, Wales.

                            Ellipses should be used to indicate gaps in quoted material, and they should not be placed in brackets in this context. Used this way, an ellipsis always has one space before it and one space after. Do not use ellipses for other purposes, such as to indicate pauses in speech. In opinion pieces and other nonnews items, it is sometimes permissible to use an ellipsis to indicate the trailing off of a sentence: <i>But if only he had tried…</i> In this case, do not use a period and do not precede the ellipsis by a space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do not use ellipses at the beginning and end of direct quotes, even if the quoted statement is only part of a longer sentence. Right: <i>“I am a fool,” Nixon said.</i> Wrong: <i>“… I am a fool …,” Nixon said.</i>

                            <i>Homicide</i> is a legal term for slaying or killing.

                        <p>
                            <i>Murder</i> is malicious, premeditated homicide. Connecticut also defines certain homicides as <i>felony murders</i> if the killing occurs in the course of the commission of a felony.

                        <p>

                        <p>
                            A person should not be described as a <i>murderer</i> until convicted of the charge. Unless authorities say premeditation was obvious, do not say that a victim <i>was murdered</i> until someone has been convicted in court. Instead, say that a victim <i>was killed</i> or <i>was slain</i>.

                        <p>
                            For compound modifiers, use the ambiguity test: Could a reasonable person read two plausible meanings from a nonhyphenated phrase? Ambiguous phrases such as <i>gay history professor</i> have appeared in News headlines. Does the person in question teach and study gay history, or is he just a history professor who happens to be gay? A hyphen should have been used to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the former.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use a hyphen to clarify individual modifiers and their targets within a compound modifier, but you may omit the hyphen IF the modifying phrase is clearly an inseparable unit (high school, financial aid, navy blue).

                            Never join an adverb ending in -ly to any other modifier: <i>frequently asked questions</i>. This is not a compound modifier; rather, the adverb is modifying the adjective and the adjective is modifying the noun.

                        <p>
                            FIRST REFERENCE Use <i>Rep.</i>, <i>Reps.</i>, <i>Sen.</i> and <i>Sens.</i> as formal titles before one or more names in regular text. Spell out and capitalize these titles before one or more names in a direct quotation. Spell out and lowercase <i>representative</i> and <i>senator</i> in other uses. Spell out other legislative titles in all uses. Capitalize formal titles such as <i>alder</i>, <i>assemblyman</i>, <i>assemblywoman</i>, <i>delegate</i> etc., when they are used before a name. See <a href="#alder">alder</a> and <a href="#board_of_alders">Board of Alders</a> for more information on New Haven’s legislative body.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use <i>U.S.</i> or <i>state</i> before a title only if necessary to void confusion: <i>U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy spoke with state Sen. Martin Looney</i>. Do not capitalize <i>state</i>. For Connecticut House members, use <i>state Rep. Roland Lemar</i>, not <i>Assemblyman Roland Lemar</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A legislative title, such as <i>representative</i>, <i>senator</i> or <i>alder</i>, is normal in most stories. It is not mandatory on first reference, however, provided an individual’s title is given later in the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deletion of the title on first reference is frequently appropriate, for example, when an individual has become well-known: <i>In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor, Joseph Lieberman today called for cooperation as Congress struggles over a Republican-backed tax plan. The Connecticut senator said he was “tired of partisan rancor.”</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SECOND REFERENCE Do not use legislative titles on second reference unless they are part of a direct quotation, or (as above) if they have not been previously used in the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CONGRESSMAN, CONGRESSWOMAN <i>Rep.</i> and <i>U.S. Rep.</i> are the preferred first-reference forms when used before the name of a U.S. House member. The words <i>congressman</i> and <i>congresswoman</i>, in lowercase, may be used in subsequent references that do not use an individual’s name, just as <i>senator</i> is used in references to members of the Senate. <i>Congressman</i> and <i>congresswoman</i> should appear as capitalized formal titles before a name only in direct quotation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do not use <i>congressperson</i>.

                        <ul>

                            <li>Simplify the name as much as possible. Do not use middle names or initials unless requested by the individual or frequently used: <i>Frank O. Gehry</i>.</li>

                            Equivalent terms for a plea that may be entered by a defendant in a criminal case. When a defendant enters this plea, it means that he is not admitting guilt but is stating that he will offer no defense. The person is then subject to being judged guilty and punished as if he had pleaded guilty or had been convicted. The principal difference is that the defendant retains the option of denying the same charge in another legal proceeding. In general, avoid referring to a person as <i>guilty</i> of a crime if he pleads <i>no contest</i>.

                            Consult the AP Stylebook for the rules on including the party and district of a legislator from outside Connecticut. In general, a party affiliation is preferred. It is assumed that legislators for whom the state is not given represent some or all of Connecticut: <i>Sen. Chris Murphy said he likes fish.</i> In general, avoid giving the numbered district of state House and Senate members. Rather, provide the area of the state they represent in a nonabbreviated form: <i>Democratic Sen. Gary Winfield of New Haven said he hates fish. Hartford Rep. Omar Daal, a Republican, agreed.</i> Or: <i>Rep. Omar Daal, R-Hartford, agreed.</i>

                            Always spell out the word, but always use figures even for percentages less than 10, e.g. <i>3 percent</i>, except when beginning a sentence. A leading zero is required for percentages less than 1 percent, e.g. <i>0.12 percent</i>. Unlike the AP Stylebook, the News uses a leading zero in sports percentages as well, e.g. <i>Derek Jeter batted 0.349 in the 1999 Major League Baseball season.</i> Do not use %, except in tabular material that is space-constricted or in stories published by the data desk or in headlines. Note the difference between <i>percent</i> and <i>percentage point</i>, e.g. a 20 percent increase is not the same as an increase of 20 percentage points.

                            The Yale Police Department is a chartered police department in the city of New Haven. Its officers have full powers of arrest. When referring to police officers, capitalize officer before the name. Examples: <i>Officer Chen</i>, <i>Officer Huang</i> etc.

                        <p>
                            New Haven’s police department is officially the <i>Department of Police Service</i>. Do not use this name unless a story demands the formality. In most uses, <i>New Haven Police Department</i> is appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>NHPD</i> and <i>YPD</i> are acceptable on second reference and in headlines, as are <i>New Haven Police</i> and <i>Yale Police</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that <i>Police Department</i>, in reference to a specific department, retains capitalization, although it should only be used on second reference and when it is clear which department is meant. Lowercase <i>police department</i> in generic use or in reference to multiple departments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When referring to a police agency, <i>police</i> should be lowercase: <i>New Haven police are investigating the murder. The Yale Police Department recently opened a new police station. He is a captain in the State Police. Jones said state police are increasing their vigilance on highways.</i>
                        </p>

Never capitalize <i>professor</i> before a name. Use the person’s full title or a restatement of the title if it appears after the name: <i>The complaint was filed by Mary Smith, an associate professor in the Chemical Engineering Department. He gave the document to Joe Smith, who is a senior lector in the German department.</i> Also acceptable: <i>He gave the document to Ed Smith, who is an associate professor of statistics.</i>

                            FACULTY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Men and women who teach classes in Yale College and the Graduate School are given various titles by the University. These titles include: <i>professor</i>, <i>associate professor</i>, <i>assistant professor</i>, <i>adjunct professor</i>, <i>lecturer</i>, <i>lector</i> and <i>senior lector</i>.

                            ENDOWED PROFESSORSHIPS Some professor hold endowed positions named after a benefactor. It is not necessary to give the full name of the endowed position unless it is relevant to the story.

                            EMERITUS A full professor — not an associate or assistant professor — is given the designation <i>emeritus</i> upon his or her retirement. It is never capitalized: <i>The book was written by Mary Smith, a professor emeritus of history.</i> Always use <i>professor emeritus</i> after a name. Do not confuse <i>emeritus</i> and <i>former</i>. A full professor who retires from Yale becomes a <i>professor emeritus</i>. Any professor who leaves Yale is a <i>former professor</i> or a <i>former Yale professor</i>, if he is a professor elsewhere. The plural is <i>professors emeriti</i>, but it is rarely used. Always place <i>emeritus</i> after <i>professor</i>.

                            Use <i>professor</i> to refer generally to a person or group of people who are on the faculty or who teach classes in Yale College or the Graduate School: <i>Several history professors said yesterday that they would leave Yale next term. A professor in Yale’s Geology Department found a new volcano in Switzerland.</i> If there is a chance that a person could be confused with a professor at another school, use <i>Yale professor</i>.

                            PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS Yale’s professional schools have varying and different designations for member of their faculties and men and women who teach their classes. Follow these guidelines:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>LAW In all references, <i>law professor</i> is appropriate: <i>He wrote the book with law professor Henry Jones.</i> Use <i>Yale law professor</i> if necessary to avoid confusion.</li>
                            <li>MEDICINE If no indication of specialty is needed, <i>medical school professor</i> is appropriate in all references and as a title before a name. Use <i>Yale medical school professor</i> if necessary to avoid confusion. Do not use <i>medical professor</i>. If an indication of specialty is needed, put the full title, followed by <i>of</i> and the specialty, after the name: <i>Henry Jones, a professor of neurobiology at the medical school, wrote the book.</i> See <a href="#public_health">Public Health</a>.</li>
                            <li>FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES If the person teaches forestry, <i>forestry professor</i> is appropriate in all references and as a title before a name. Some professors in the School of the Environment teach environmental science. In all cases, it is acceptable to use the full title after the name: <i>Karen Jones, an assistant professor at the School of the Environment.</i></li>
                            <li>ART, ARCHITECTURE, DRAMA AND MUSIC Always use the full title and identify the school after the name to avoid confusion with professors who teach these subjects in Yale College: <i>John Smith, an adjunct professor at the Art School, designed the facade. Mary Jones, a playwright-in-residence at the David Geffen School of Drama, wrote the play. Bob Martinez, an adjunct professor of composition at the Music School, led the band.</i></li>

                            The Department of Public Health (formerly the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health) is part of the School of Medicine. The department was founded in 1915 as the first academic “school of public health,” but it has never been an independent professional school. Refer to the department as <i>the School of Public Health</i>. <i>SPH</i> is acceptable on second reference but should be avoided where possible.

                            The Yale Scientific School was founded in 1854 and renamed the Sheffield Scientific School in 1861 after a generous donor. The school’s board was incorporated in 1871 to promote the study of the physical, natural and mathematical sciences in the school, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. After World War I, the Yale College and Sheffield Scientific School programs, formerly quite separate, gradually merged until, in 1956, the latter school as a separate entity was no longer active.

If, however, it is appropriate in the context of the story to provide the formal title, do so. These principles apply as well to the director of public affairs: <i>Helaine Klasky, a spokesman for the University, said Levin had no comment.</i> But: <i>An addition to the president’s inner circle was Larry Haas, the director of public affairs, who served as Levin’s right-hand man when Yale needed to sell its projects to a wider audience. A University spokesman had no comment.</i> Spokesperson and spokeswoman are also acceptable.

                            Deliberative councils appointed by University officials to advise them on policy relating to certain areas. Each committee is designed to deal with a specific area either by charge of a University officer or on its own. All committee appointments are yearlong commitments. In all cases, committee recommendations are subject to the authority of the appointing officer.

                            There are hundreds of graduate, professional and undergraduate student organizations in Yale University. Some organizations in Yale College register with the Yale College Dean’s Office and qualify for funding through that office. Be careful of using the term student organization or undergraduate organization for a club or group that is not registered, since those designations are often reserved for registered organizations. Rather, use <i>student group</i> or a more precise designation.

                            A teaching assistant in Yale College is a person, normally a graduate student and occasionally a professional student, who serves as a secondary instructor in a Yale College course. Teaching assistants normally lead sections and grade assignments in larger courses. When referring to graduate students who serve as teaching assistants, especially in stories about Local 33 or the graduate student unionization controversy, avoid terms such as <i>graduate teachers</i> or <i>graduate teaching assistants</i>. Use <i>graduate student teaching assistants</i> when it is necessary to refer to that subset of teaching assistants whose members are graduate students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On second reference, TA is acceptable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The formal Yale title for teaching assistants is <i>teaching fellow</i>. It should be avoided, except in specific contexts when it is necessary to discuss the formal rank. Yale distinguishes positions (teaching fellow 1, teaching fellow 2, teaching fellow 3, teaching fellow 3.5, teaching fellow 4) depending on the teaching load and type.

                            The University grants tenured faculty members a permanent teaching and research appointment. Their tenure can never be revoked except by extraordinary action of the University Tribunal in cases of moral turpitude. There is no mandatory retirement.

                            <i>That</i> can usually be omitted when following <i>said</i> and similar words. Include <i>that</i> when the words after <i>said</i> can be mistaken for its object: <i>The mayor announced that his party's tax program would undergo an official investigation.</i> Also include <i>that</i> to avoid ambiguity when there is a time element or a subordinate clause introduced by <i>although</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>while</i> or something similar: <i>The governor said today that she would sign the income-tax bill. She said that although the tax would bankrupt most citizens, the government needed the money.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In compound sentences it is sometimes necessary to use <i>and that</i> in the second half of the compound. In such cases, <i>that</i> should be used in the first half to maintain parallel structure: <i>The mayor said that he might run for governor and that, if he did, Joan Smith would be his campaign manager.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also be wary of the difference between <i>that</i> and <i>which</i>. The former is a restrictive pronoun: The clause it introduces must be essential to the meaning of the noun it modifies. The latter introduces nonessential information. An example should suffice to show the difference:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(EXAMPLE) <i>The car that I have in my garage is for sale.</i> In this sentence, the clause is necessary to indicate which car is being spoken about. Perhaps another car, in the driveway, is not for sale.</li>
                            <li>(EXAMPLE) <i>The car, which I have in my garage, is for sale.</i> The clause only provides more information about the car; it is not necessary to the car’s identification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Note the use of commas in the examples. Clauses introduced by <i>that</i> are never set off by commas. Clauses introduced by <i>which</i> almost always are.

                            It is preferable to use days of the week in stories rather than relative terms. For example, say an event happened <i>Monday</i> rather than <i>yesterday</i> or will occur <i>Wednesday</i> rather than <i>tomorrow</i>. The use of <i>today</i>, however, is often preferable to a day of the week in order to avoid confusing the reader. Note that <i>today</i> always refers to the day on which a story is published, usually the day after it is written.

                            Women should receive the same treatment as men in all areas of coverage. Physical descriptions, sexist references, demeaning stereotypes and condescending phrases should not be used. To cite some examples, this means:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Copy should not assume maleness when both sexes are involved, as in <i>Jackson told newsmen</i> or in the <i>taxpayer … he</i> when it easily can be said <i>Jackson told reporters</i> or <i>taxpayers … they</i>.</li>
                            <li>Copy should not express surprise that an attractive woman can be professionally accomplished, as in: <i>Mary Smith doesn’t look the part, but she’s an authority on…</i></li>
                            <li>Copy should not gratuitously mention family relationships when there is no relevance to the subject, as in: <i>Golda Meir, a doughty grandmother, told the Egyptians today…</i></li>
                            <li>Use the same standards for men and women in deciding whether to include specific mention of personal appearance or marital and family situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In other words, treatment of the sexes should be evenhanded and free of assumptions and stereotypes. This does not mean that valid and acceptable words such as <i>mankind</i> cannot be used. “Politically correct” coined words are seldom acceptable except in direct quotations.
